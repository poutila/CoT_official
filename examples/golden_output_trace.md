### Decision: Refactor the payment processing module to improve maintainability

#### Risk Assessment:
- **Change Type**: Refactor module structure
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Impact Scope**: Module
- **Reversibility**: Moderate effort to reverse

#### Evidence Collection:

1. **Source**: `architecture_guidelines.md:45`
   **Quote**: "All modules should follow single responsibility principle"
   **Relevance**: Supports modular refactoring approach
   **Timestamp**:
     - Created: 2024-01-15T10:00:00Z
     - Modified: 2024-01-20T14:00:00Z

   **Freshness**: current (score: 0.95)

2. **Source**: `code_review_notes.md:102`
   **Quote**: "Consider splitting large modules into smaller components"
   **Relevance**: Directly suggests the refactoring approach
   **Timestamp**:
     - Created: 2024-01-25T09:00:00Z
     - Modified: 2024-01-25T09:00:00Z
     - Accessed: 2024-01-26T12:00:00Z
   **Freshness**: current (score: 0.99)

#### Analysis:
- **Primary rationale**: Based on 2 evidence sources, refactor the payment processing module to improve maintainability is justified
- **Alternative considered**: Maintain current structure with documentation updates
- **Alternative rejected because**: Evidence strongly supports the proposed change

#### Validation:
- [âœ“] Minimum 2 evidence sources cited (have 2)
- [âœ“] No assumptions made beyond quoted text
- [âœ“] All affected files identified
- [âœ“] Edge cases addressed

#### Action:
â†’ Therefore, I will: Execute refactor the payment processing module to improve maintainability following best practices
