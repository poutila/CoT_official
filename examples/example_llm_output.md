# Example: Real LLM Output with CoT Reasoning

This file shows an actual LLM response following the Chain-of-Thought specification.

## User Query
"I found a utility module called `legacy_helpers.py` that seems unused. Should I delete it?"

## LLM Response (Following CoT v7.0.0)

## 🧠 Reasoning Trace (Chain-of-Thought)

```yaml
schema: chain_of_thought/v7.0.0
validation: required
runtime_contract: 2.0.0
context_level: full_file_access

```

**Context Level**: Full File Access
**Available Tools**: File reading, grep search, import analysis

### Decision: Evaluate whether to delete legacy_helpers.py

#### Risk Assessment:
- **Change Type**: Delete file
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Impact Scope**: Potentially module-wide
- **Reversibility**: Easily reversible (via git)

#### Evidence Collection:
1. **Source**: `legacy_helpers.py:1-5`
   **Quote**: "# Legacy utility functions - Deprecated as of v2.0"
   **Relevance**: File is explicitly marked as deprecated
   **Timestamp**:
     - Created: 2022-03-15T10:00:00Z
     - Modified: 2023-06-20T14:30:00Z
     - Accessed: 2024-01-26T15:45:00Z
   **Freshness**: stale (score: 0.65)

2. **Source**: `grep -r "import legacy_helpers" --include="*.py"`
   **Quote**: "No matches found"
   **Relevance**: No direct imports found in Python files
   **Timestamp**:
     - Created: 2024-01-26T15:45:00Z
     - Modified: 2024-01-26T15:45:00Z
     - Accessed: 2024-01-26T15:45:00Z
   **Freshness**: current (score: 1.0)

3. **Source**: `grep -r "from legacy_helpers import" --include="*.py"`
   **Quote**: "No matches found"
   **Relevance**: No from-imports found either
   **Timestamp**:
     - Created: 2024-01-26T15:45:00Z
     - Modified: 2024-01-26T15:45:00Z

   **Freshness**: current (score: 1.0)

4. **Source**: `git log --oneline legacy_helpers.py | head -5`
   **Quote**: "a4f3d21 2023-06-20 Mark as deprecated\n9b2c1fa 2023-01-15 Remove last usage"
   **Relevance**: Last functional change removed all usage
   **Timestamp**:
     - Created: 2024-01-26T15:45:00Z
     - Modified: 2024-01-26T15:45:00Z
     - Accessed: 2024-01-26T15:45:00Z
   **Freshness**: current (score: 1.0)

#### Analysis:
- **Primary rationale**: File marked deprecated 8 months ago, no imports found, last usage removed over a year ago
- **Alternative considered**: Keep file with stronger deprecation warning
- **Alternative rejected because**: No usage for >1 year, search confirmed zero imports

#### Validation:
- [✓] Minimum 2 evidence sources cited (have 4)
- [✓] No assumptions made beyond quoted text
- [✓] All affected files identified (none found)
- [⚠️] Edge cases addressed (see note below)

**Note**: Should check for dynamic imports using `__import__` or `importlib`

#### Action:
→ Therefore, I will: Delete `legacy_helpers.py` after checking for dynamic imports

Recommended additional check:
```bash
grep -r "__import__\|importlib.import_module" --include="*.py" | grep -i legacy_helpers
```

If this returns no results, proceed with deletion.
