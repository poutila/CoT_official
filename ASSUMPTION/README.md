# 🧠 README: Usage of `Assumption` Object in Chain of Thought Systems

## 📘 What is an `Assumption`?

An `Assumption` is an unverified but accepted premise — taken to be true for the sake of argument or reasoning.

It is:
- ⚠️ Not necessarily verified or provable
- ✅ Scoped to a specific domain, task, or reasoning path

## 🔹 Use Cases in Chain of Thought (CoT) Systems

| Use Case                  | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔧 Hypothetical Reasoning | Enables exploration under "what if" conditions                              |
| 🧱 Premise Foundation      | Used as a base layer for reasoning or planning                             |
| 📊 Scope-sensitive Models | Filtered or activated based on logical contexts                            |
| 🗂️ Model Configuration     | Act as constraints or flags during execution                               |

## ✅ Code Examples

### 1. Use in Reasoning Chains

```python
if assumption.is_assumption():
    reasoning_chain.append(assumption.statement)
```

### 2. Semantic Comparison

```python
reference = "The environment remains stable during execution."
if validate_against_assumption(assumption, reference):
    print("Assumption aligns with expected scope.")
```

### 3. Vector Embedding

```python
embedding = model.encode(assumption.statement)
```

## 🔗 Integration in AI Pipelines

- **Input**: Assumptions define constraints or system expectations
- **Intermediate**: Reasoning branches can diverge based on assumption sets
- **Output**: AI systems can declare assumptions for transparency or risk tracking

## 📦 Suggestion

Store assumptions as `.json` or `.jsonl` using `ASSUMPTION_SCHEMA.json` for structure-aware reasoning.
