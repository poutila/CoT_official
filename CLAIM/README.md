# 🧠 README: Usage of `Claim` Object in Chain of Thought Systems

## 📘 What is a `Claim`?

A `Claim` is a statement proposed to be true, but not yet confirmed or verified.  
It may be supported, contradicted, or refined using facts, assumptions, or further reasoning.

It may:
- ⚠️ Be **uncertain**: Backed by varying levels of confidence or evidence.
- ⚠️ Be **subjective**: Depending on source, time, or interpretation.

## 🔹 Use Cases in Chain of Thought (CoT) Systems

| Use Case                  | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 💬 Argument Construction   | Used as the basis of a position or thesis                                  |
| 🔍 Validation              | Compared to facts for verification or contradiction                        |
| 📊 Uncertainty Propagation | Carries confidence scores into reasoning                                   |
| 🧠 Hypothesis Generation   | Treated as starting points for exploration                                 |
| 📂 Claim Graphs            | Structured into argument trees or semantic graphs                          |

## ✅ Code Examples

### 1. Use in Reasoning Chains

```python
if claim.is_claim():
    reasoning_chain.append(claim.statement)
```

### 2. Semantic Validation

```python
reference = "Humans will land on Mars by 2050."
if validate_against_claim(claim, reference):
    print("Claim matches reference.")
```

### 3. Vector Embedding

```python
embedding = model.encode(claim.statement)
```

## 🔗 Integration in AI Pipelines

- **Input**: Accepted claims serve as hypotheses or premises
- **Intermediate**: Claims are confirmed or refuted with facts
- **Output**: AI may generate new claims to be reviewed by humans or validators

## 📦 Suggestion

Store claims as `.json` or `.jsonl` using `CLAIM_SCHEMA.json` to support structured analysis and comparison.
