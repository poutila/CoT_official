## 📝 COMPLETION SUMMARY PHILOSOPHY

> "Knowledge is cheap, disc space is cheaper, lost context is expensive."

**EVERY completed task gets a summary - NO EXCEPTIONS**
- Use [TASK_COMPLETION_TEMPLATE.md](TASK_COMPLETION_TEMPLATE.md) for tasks ≥3 points
- Use [TASK_COMPLETION_MINIMAL.md](TASK_COMPLETION_MINIMAL.md) for 1-2 point tasks
- Store in `completions/T-XXX_COMPLETION.md`

Why document everything?
- Today's "obvious" fix is tomorrow's mystery
- Patterns emerge from accumulated decisions
- Time estimates improve with historical data
- Onboarding becomes self-service
