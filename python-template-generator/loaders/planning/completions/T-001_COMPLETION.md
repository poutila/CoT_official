## ðŸŽ¯ What Was Done

### Acceptance Criteria Status
- [x] `tests/` directory properly structured
- [x] `pytest.ini` or test config in `pyproject.toml` - Used pyproject.toml
- [x] At least 1 passing test for any module - Created 8 tests!
- [x] Coverage report generates successfully - 64% coverage
- [x] Can run: `uv run pytest` - Works perfectly

### Key Implementation Details
1. **Approach Taken**: Created comprehensive test suite for main.py with mocking
2. **Technologies Used**: pytest, pytest-cov, unittest.mock
3. **Files Created/Modified**:
   - `tests/conftest.py` - 5 reusable fixtures
   - `tests/test_main.py` - 8 comprehensive tests
   - `pyproject.toml` - Added pytest configuration

### Code Snippets
```python
# Key fixture pattern that proved useful
@pytest.fixture
def sample_markdown_file(temp_dir: Path) -> Path:
    """Create a sample markdown file for testing."""
    content = """# Test Document
## Section 1
Test content here.
"""
    md_file = temp_dir / "test.md"
    md_file.write_text(content)
    return md_file
```

## ðŸ’¡ Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- Fixture-based testing approach very clean
- Mocking external dependencies avoided complex setup
- Coverage far exceeded expectations (64% vs 10% target)

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Challenge**: Initial confusion about project structure
   - **Solution**: Read through main.py to understand entry points
   - **Time Impact**: +15 minutes

### Discoveries
- Project had ZERO tests before this task
- Main.py was well-structured for testing with clear separation
- UV package manager works seamlessly with pytest

## ðŸ”„ Impact on Other Tasks

### Dependencies Resolved
- Unblocked T-002 (Test Document Enricher)
- Unblocked T-003 (Test Validators)
- Enabled all future testing tasks

### New Tasks Discovered
None - infrastructure is solid

### Technical Debt Created/Resolved
- **Resolved**: Moved from 0% to 64% coverage
- **Created**: None

## ðŸš€ Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Immediate Next Task**: T-002 - Test Document Enricher (builds on this foundation)
2. **Related Improvements**: Consider adding integration tests later
3. **Refactoring Opportunities**: None needed currently
