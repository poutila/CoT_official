# Task Completion Summaries

This directory contains detailed completion summaries for finished tasks, providing implementation details, lessons learned, and knowledge transfer for future development.

## Purpose

- **Knowledge Preservation**: Capture implementation details and decisions
- **Learning Repository**: Document challenges and solutions for future reference
- **Metrics Tracking**: Record actual vs estimated effort and achievement
- **Pattern Library**: Collect reusable code patterns and approaches
- **Sprint Retrospectives**: Support data-driven sprint reviews

## Structure

Files are named: `T-XXX_COMPLETION.md` where XXX is the task ID.

## When to Create a Completion Summary

### Required for ALL completed tasks:
- Every task marked as "âœ… Completed" MUST have a completion summary
- No exceptions - even 1-point tasks get documented
- Bug fixes, documentation updates, maintenance - ALL get summaries
- Knowledge is cheap, disc space is cheaper, lost context is expensive

### Why document everything?
- Even "simple" fixes teach lessons
- Today's trivial task is tomorrow's "how did we do that?"
- Patterns emerge from accumulated small decisions
- New team members need full context, not just highlights

## Template

Use [TASK_COMPLETION_TEMPLATE.md](../TASK_COMPLETION_TEMPLATE.md) when creating new summaries.

## Completed Tasks

| Task ID | Title | Points | Completion Date | Key Achievement |
|---------|-------|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| T-001 | Create Basic Test Infrastructure | 3 | 2025-01-08 | 64% coverage from 0% |
| T-002 | Test Document Enricher | 5 | 2025-01-08 | 93% enricher coverage, fixed 3 tests |

## Metrics Summary

### Sprint 1 (2025-01-08 to 2025-01-22)
- **Tasks Completed**: 2/6
- **Story Points Completed**: 8/20
- **Average Coverage Gain per Task**: +32%
- **Tests Written**: 23
- **Success Rate**: 100% (all completed tasks met acceptance criteria)

## Key Patterns Discovered

### Testing Patterns
1. **Fixture-based test data** - Reusable test fixtures in conftest.py
2. **Mock file system operations** - Avoid real file I/O in unit tests
3. **Section finding in assertions** - Robust pattern for finding sections by title

### Implementation Patterns
1. **UV package manager** - Consistent use of `uv run` for all commands
2. **Coverage-driven development** - Test until coverage target met
3. **Incremental fixing** - Fix one test at a time with targeted solutions

## Lessons Learned Across Tasks

### What Works Well
- Comprehensive test fixtures reduce duplication
- Mocking external dependencies keeps tests fast
- Clear acceptance criteria drive completion

### Common Challenges
- Initial project understanding takes time
- Test failures often need specific domain knowledge
- Coverage targets ambitious but achievable
