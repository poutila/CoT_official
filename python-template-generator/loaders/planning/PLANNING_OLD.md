**Data Flow**:
1. Markdown passed to enricher
2. Rules and enriched document passed to validators
3. Validation report and enriched document

## üîß DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

### SOLID Principles
All architecture and refactoring decisions should adhere to the SOLID principles:
- **S - Single Responsibility**: Each class/module has one reason to change
- **O - Open/Closed**: Software entities open for extension, closed for modification
- **L - Liskov Substitution**: Derived classes must be substitutable for base classes
- **I - Interface Segregation**: Clients shouldn't depend on methods they don't use
- **D - Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

Applied consistently across services, domain models, and infrastructure modules. See [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) for detailed examples and enforcement rules.

### Code Quality Enforcement Tools
**Automated Quality Gates**:
- **Type Checking**: mypy (strict mode) - zero type violations allowed
- **Linting**: ruff (PEP8 + custom rules) - automatic formatting and error detection
- **Testing**: pytest + pytest-cov - 90%+ coverage requirement
- **Mutation Testing**: mutmut - 80%+ score for business logic modules
- **Security Scanning**: bandit + safety - zero critical vulnerabilities
- **Complexity Analysis**: radon - cyclomatic complexity ‚â§ 10 per function
- **Dependency Health**: pip-audit - monitor for vulnerable packages

All tools integrated into pre-commit hooks and CI/CD pipeline with zero-tolerance failure policy.

### AI Code Assistance Policy

## ü§ñ AUTOMATION DESIGN OVERVIEW

> **Strategic Automation**: The project implements comprehensive automation to reduce manual overhead, ensure consistency, and maintain compliance while preserving human oversight and decision-making authority.

### Automation Philosophy
**Human-Centric Automation**: All automation serves to amplify human productivity and decision-making rather than replace human judgment. Critical decisions, security changes, and architectural choices remain under human control.

**Fail-Safe Design**: Automation systems include human override capabilities, error recovery procedures, and graceful degradation when systems fail.

**Audit-Compliant**: All automated actions maintain complete audit trails for regulatory compliance and retrospective analysis.

### Core Automation Systems

#### **Task Management Automation**
**Bidirectional GitHub Integration**: Seamless synchronization between GitHub issues/PRs and TASK.md files.

**Key Features**:
- **Real-time Status Sync**: Task status updates automatically when GitHub issues/PRs change state
- **Review Status Tracking**: PR reviews automatically update task review status (‚úîÔ∏è/üîç/‚ö†Ô∏è/üöÄ)
- **Label Synchronization**: GitHub labels mirror TASK.md priorities and types
- **Task ID Linkage**: `task_id: T-XXX` references create automatic bidirectional connections

**Benefits**: Eliminates manual sync overhead, ensures consistency, provides single source of truth

#### **Sprint File Management**
**Automated Sprint Transitions**: Complete sprint boundary management with archival and new sprint initialization.

**Process Flow**:
1. **Archive Trigger**: Manual workflow dispatch or scheduled sprint end
2. **File Versioning**: Current TASK.md archived as immutable compliance record
3. **New Sprint Creation**: Fresh TASK.md generated from template with updated sprint metadata
4. **Archive Indexing**: Automatic update of sprint archive navigation

**Compliance Value**: Immutable audit trails, regulatory compliance, historical analysis capability

#### **Quality Assurance Automation**
**Continuous Quality Gates**: Automated enforcement of CLAUDE.md standards without human intervention.

**Validation Pipeline**:
- **Task Validation**: Automated TASK.md format and consistency checking
- **Code Quality**: Type checking, linting, formatting, security scanning
- **Test Coverage**: Automated coverage reporting and mutation testing
- **Documentation**: Link validation and cross-reference checking

**Standards Enforcement**: Zero-tolerance automation ensures consistent adherence to governance standards

#### **Metadata & Metrics Automation**
**Real-time Dashboard Updates**: Automatic calculation and display of project health metrics.

**Automated Metrics**:
- **Sprint Progress**: Task completion rates and burndown calculations
- **Quality Indicators**: Code coverage, test success rates, security scan results
- **Process Metrics**: Review cycle times, deployment frequency, incident response
- **Health Scoring**: Overall project health based on multiple indicators

**Executive Value**: Real-time visibility without manual reporting overhead

### Project-Specific Pattern examples
**Service Layer Pattern**:
```python
# Services orchestrate domain logic and external calls
class UserRegistrationService:
    def __init__(self, user_repo: UserRepository, email_service: EmailService):
        self.user_repo = user_repo
        self.email_service = email_service

    def register_user(self, user_data: UserRegistrationData) -> User:
        # Validation, business logic, external calls
        pass
```

**Repository Pattern**:
```python
# Data access abstraction
class UserRepository(Protocol):
    def save(self, user: User) -> User: ...
    def find_by_email(self, email: str) -> Optional[User]: ...
```

**Configuration Management**:
```python
# Centralized config with environment-specific overrides
class Settings(BaseSettings):
    database_url: str
    redis_url: str
    api_secret_key: SecretStr

    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"
```

**CI/CD Pipeline**:
1. Unit tests (parallel execution)
2. Integration tests (with test DB)
3. E2E tests (against staging environment)
4. Performance tests (load testing key endpoints)

### Testing Service-Level Objectives
**Development Workflow SLAs**:
- **Pull request review cycle**: < 24 hours (business days)
- **All tests execution time**: < 5 minutes (local and CI)
- **Mutation testing score**: > 80% for business logic modules
- **Flaky test remediation**: Quarantined within 1 sprint, fixed within 2 sprints
- **Test data setup**: < 30 seconds for integration test suite
- **Coverage report generation**: < 2 minutes

**Mutation Testing Protocol**:
- **Tracking**: Results stored in `tests/mutants/{module_name}.json` per module
- **Thresholds**: Business logic (80%+), utilities (70%+), integrations (60%+)
- **Quarantine Policy**: Tests failing >3 times in 48 hours are auto-quarantined
- **Reintroduction**: Quarantined tests reviewed weekly, fixed tests re-enabled after 2 consecutive passes

**Quality Gates**:
- Zero failing tests before merge
- No reduction in coverage percentage
- All security scans pass
- Performance tests within acceptable thresholds

### Story Points Estimation Framework
**Purpose**: Story points provide relative effort estimation independent of individual developer speed or calendar time.

**Fibonacci-Based Scale**:
| Points | Complexity | Time Range | Description | Examples |
|--------|------------|------------|-------------|----------|
| **1** | Trivial | < 2 hours | Simple config changes, documentation fixes | Update README, change environment variable |
| **2** | Small | 2-4 hours | Minor features, simple bug fixes | Add validation rule, fix CSS styling |
| **3** | Moderate | 4-8 hours (‚â§1 day) | Standard features, typical bug fixes | Create API endpoint, implement form validation |
| **5** | Complex | 1-3 days | Multi-step features, complex integrations | User authentication flow, third-party API integration |
| **8** | Large | 3-5 days | Significant features, major refactoring | Payment processing system, complex data migration |
| **13** | Epic | 1-2 weeks | Major features, architectural changes | New user dashboard, microservice extraction |
| **21** | Epic+ | > 2 weeks | Large initiatives requiring breakdown | Complete redesign, new product module |

**Estimation Guidelines**:
- **Relative Sizing**: Compare against previously completed tasks
- **Include All Work**: Development + testing + documentation + review time
- **Account for Unknowns**: Add points for research, learning, or uncertainty
- **Team Calibration**: Regularly review completed tasks to align estimation

**Epic Breakdown Rules**:
- **13+ Points**: Consider breaking into smaller tasks
- **21+ Points**: Must be broken down into 3-8 point sub-tasks
- **Epic Tracking**: Use separate `epics/E-XXX.md` files for large initiatives

**Velocity Calculation**:
- **Sprint Velocity**: Total points completed in a sprint
- **Team Velocity**: Average points per sprint over last 3-6 sprints
- **Capacity Planning**: Use velocity to plan future sprint commitments
