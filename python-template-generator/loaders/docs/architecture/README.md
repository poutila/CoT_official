# 🏗️ Architecture Documentation

> **Purpose**: System architecture, design decisions, and technical overview
> **Standards**: Follows guidelines in [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md)
> **Context**: See [PLANNING.md](../../planning/PLANNING.md) for detailed architecture

## 🎯 System Overview

The Bullet Proof project is a robust task management and automation system designed with security and reliability as core principles.

### Core Components

1. **Task Management System**
   - Sprint-based planning
   - Fibonacci scoring system
   - Automated task synchronization

2. **Automation Framework**
   - GitHub Actions workflows
   - Failure recovery mechanisms
   - Comprehensive audit trails

3. **Security Layer**
   - Input validation at all boundaries
   - Encrypted data storage
   - Rate limiting and access controls

## 🔧 Technical Stack

### Languages & Frameworks
- **Python 3.11.9+** - Primary language
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD and automation
- **Pytest** - Testing framework
- **FastAPI** - API framework (when applicable)

### Development Tools
- **uv** - Fast Python package manager
- **mypy** - Static type checking
- **ruff** - Linting and formatting
- **black** - Code formatting
- **bandit** - Security scanning

## 📋 Architecture Principles

### SOLID Principles (Mandatory)
All components follow SOLID principles as defined in [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md#solid-design-principles-required-for-all-architecture).

### Security First
- Zero-trust architecture
- Defense in depth
- Principle of least privilege
- Fail-safe defaults

### High Availability
- Automated recovery procedures
- Comprehensive error handling
- Graceful degradation
- Circuit breakers for external services

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. **Input** → Validation → Sanitization
2. **Processing** → Domain logic → Service orchestration
3. **Persistence** → Database with audit trail
4. **Output** → Response formatting → Security headers

## 🚀 Deployment Architecture

- **Environment separation**: Dev, staging, production
- **Configuration management**: Environment variables
- **Secret management**: Never in code, always in secure storage
- **Monitoring**: Health checks, metrics, alerts

## 📊 Performance Targets

- API response time: < 200ms
- Background task completion: < 5 minutes
- Test suite execution: < 10 minutes
- 99.9% uptime SLA

## 🔒 Security Architecture

See [Security Considerations](../../CLAUDE.md#critical---security--data-integrity-zero-tolerance) for detailed security requirements.

### Key Security Features
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting (100 req/min default)
- JWT with 15-minute access tokens
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Automated security scanning

## 🎭 Architecture Decision Records

Architecture decisions are documented in the [ADR directory](../adr//README.md). Each significant decision includes:
- Context and problem statement
- Considered options
- Decision and rationale
- Consequences
