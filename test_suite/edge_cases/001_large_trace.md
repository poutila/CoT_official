### Decision: Comprehensive refactoring of legacy system

#### Risk Assessment:
- **Change Type**: System-wide refactoring
- **Risk Level**: Critical
- **Impact Scope**: Entire application
- **Reversibility**: Very difficult

#### Evidence Collection:
[Large evidence collection with 15 items]

1. **Source**: `system_audit.pdf:page-45`
   **Quote**: "Technical debt has reached critical levels with 89% of modules requiring updates"
   **Relevance**: Quantifies the scope of required changes

15. **Source**: `performance_metrics.csv:row-1247`
    **Quote**: "Response time degraded 340% over 6 months"
    **Relevance**: Performance requires architectural changes
    **Timestamp**:
      - Created: 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z
      - Modified: 2024-01-26T11:00:00Z
      - Accessed: 2024-01-26T12:00:00Z
    **Freshness**: current (score: 0.99)

#### Analysis:
- **Primary rationale**: Multiple critical issues across security, performance, and maintainability
- **Alternative considered**: Incremental module-by-module updates
- **Alternative rejected because**: Dependencies too intertwined, security issues need immediate resolution

#### Conflict Resolution:
Multiple evidence sources suggest different priorities:
- Security team: Fix vulnerabilities first
- Performance team: Address bottlenecks first
- Architecture team: Clean structure first

Resolution strategy: **weighted_consensus**
- Security weight: 0.5 (critical)
- Performance weight: 0.3 (important)
- Architecture weight: 0.2 (foundational)

Minority report: Architecture team believes structure should precede other changes

#### Extended Analysis:
Given the evidence complexity, breaking down into phases:

Phase 1: Security hardening (2 weeks)
- SQL injection fixes
- Authentication updates
- Input validation

Phase 2: Performance critical path (3 weeks)
- Database query optimization
- Caching layer implementation
- API response optimization

Phase 3: Architecture refactoring (6 weeks)
- Module boundaries
- Dependency injection
- Service extraction

#### Validation:
- [âœ“] Minimum 5 evidence sources for critical risk (have 15)
- [âœ“] No assumptions made beyond quoted text
- [âœ“] All affected systems identified
- [âœ“] Edge cases addressed
- [âœ“] Conflict resolution applied
- [âœ“] Phased approach defined

#### Action:
â†’ Therefore, I will: Initiate comprehensive refactoring following the three-phase plan with security-first priority
