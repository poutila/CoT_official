=== STEP 1: UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT ===
State what information you have available:
- What files/data can you access? Full repository access
- What tools are available? File reading, search
- What is the specific task/decision? Remove unused import statements
- What constraints apply? Must not break any functionality

=== STEP 2: ASSESS THE RISK ===
Determine the risk level of this decision:
LOW: Easily reversible, affects only import statements

=== STEP 3: GATHER EVIDENCE ===
For each piece of evidence:
1. Source: main.py:5
2. Quote: "import unused_module  # TODO: remove"
3. Relevance: Explicitly marked for removal
4. Date/Version: File last modified 2024-01-20

1. Source: grep -r "unused_module" 
2. Quote: Only found in main.py:5
3. Relevance: Confirms module not used elsewhere
4. Date/Version: Search performed 2024-01-26

=== STEP 4: ANALYZE OPTIONS ===
List all possible actions:
- Option A: Remove the import line
  - Pros: Cleaner code, follows TODO instruction
  - Cons: None identified
  - Evidence: Both sources support removal

- Option B: Keep the import
  - Pros: No risk of breaking anything
  - Cons: Dead code, explicitly marked for removal
  - Evidence: No evidence supports keeping

=== STEP 5: MAKE DECISION ===
State your decision clearly:
- Primary action: Delete line 5 from main.py
- Justification: TODO comment + no usage found
- Confidence: 95% - very confident
- Alternative if blocked: Comment out instead of delete

=== STEP 6: VALIDATE REASONING ===
Check your work:
✓ All evidence includes exact quotes
✓ No assumptions beyond quoted text
✓ Risk level matches decision impact
✓ All affected items identified
✓ Edge cases considered
